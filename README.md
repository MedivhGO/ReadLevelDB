**Read LevelDB SourceCode**

**LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.**

# Getting the Source

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/google/leveldb.git
```

# Building

This project supports [CMake](https://cmake.org/) out of the box.

### Build for POSIX

Quick start:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && cmake --build .
```


# Contributing to the leveldb Project

The leveldb project welcomes contributions. leveldb's primary goal is to be
a reliable and fast key/value store. Changes that are in line with the
features/limitations outlined above, and meet the requirements below,
will be considered.

Contribution requirements:

1. **Tested platforms only**. We _generally_ will only accept changes for
   platforms that are compiled and tested. This means POSIX (for Linux and
   macOS) or Windows. Very small changes will sometimes be accepted, but
   consider that more of an exception than the rule.

2. **Stable API**. We strive very hard to maintain a stable API. Changes that
   require changes for projects using leveldb _might_ be rejected without
   sufficient benefit to the project.

3. **Tests**: All changes must be accompanied by a new (or changed) test, or
   a sufficient explanation as to why a new (or changed) test is not required.

4. **Consistent Style**: This project conforms to the
   [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
   To ensure your changes are properly formatted please run:

   ```
   clang-format -i --style=file <file>
   ```

## Repository contents

See [doc/index.md](doc/index.md) for more explanation. See
[doc/impl.md](doc/impl.md) for a brief overview of the implementation.

The public interface is in include/leveldb/*.h.  Callers should not include or
rely on the details of any other header files in this package.  Those
internal APIs may be changed without warning.

Guide to header files:

* **include/leveldb/db.h**: Main interface to the DB: Start here.

* **include/leveldb/options.h**: Control over the behavior of an entire database,
and also control over the behavior of individual reads and writes.

* **include/leveldb/comparator.h**: Abstraction for user-specified comparison function.
If you want just bytewise comparison of keys, you can use the default
comparator, but clients can write their own comparator implementations if they
want custom ordering (e.g. to handle different character encodings, etc.).

* **include/leveldb/iterator.h**: Interface for iterating over data. You can get
an iterator from a DB object.

* **include/leveldb/write_batch.h**: Interface for atomically applying multiple
updates to a database.

* **include/leveldb/slice.h**: A simple module for maintaining a pointer and a
length into some other byte array.

* **include/leveldb/status.h**: Status is returned from many of the public interfaces
and is used to report success and various kinds of errors.

* **include/leveldb/env.h**:
Abstraction of the OS environment.  A posix implementation of this interface is
in util/env_posix.cc.

* **include/leveldb/table.h, include/leveldb/table_builder.h**: Lower-level modules that most
clients probably won't use directly.
